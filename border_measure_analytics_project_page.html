    <h2 class="light-gray-background extra-padding centered">Background</h2>
    <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, different teams needed to analyze data related to the Canadian border. The data includes information on travellers going into Canada, such as their designated quarantine facilities, information on approved quarantine accommodations, and traveller follow ups to confirm quarantine rules are being complied.</p>

    <div class="column-list">
        <div class="column centered" style="width:30%;">
            <h2 class="light-gray-background extra-padding">Problem</h2>
            <p>A lot of analytics were based on senior management pressing needs and giving recurring stats took a lot of manual work to update and share, since so many different types of analysis were necessary.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column centered" style="width:30%;">
            <h2 class="light-gray-background extra-padding">Goal</h2>
            <p>Remove manual work and move the data analysis into a more dynamic automated data system readily available to people at PHAC.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column centered" style="width:30%;">
            <h2 class="light-gray-background extra-padding">Solution</h2>
            <p>A mostly automated Power BI dashboard showing trends on all the analytics required by the teams at PHAC.</p>
        </div>
