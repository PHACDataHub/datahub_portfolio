    <h2 class="light-gray-background extra-padding centered">Background</h2>
    <p>The Health Portfolio Operations Centre (HPOC) is temporarily established when there is a new health crisis in place (e.g. COVID-19 pandemic). HPOC needs to provide updates to health officers and decision makers related to that health crisis to update them on the trends and data of the current situation.</p>
    <p>For the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, a daily report needs to be created with information related to cases, deaths, hospitalization rates, tests, and others. It also showcases the data split by province and comparisons to other countries, to better understand Canada's situation.</p>

            <h2 class="light-gray-background extra-padding">Problem</h2>
            <p>Manually completing a daily report with the necessary information is time consuming and prone to human errors, as it entails manual work such as copy/pasting, processing of data, formatting, etc.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column centered" style="width:30%;">
            <h2 class="light-gray-background extra-padding">Goal</h2>
            <p>Automate the generation of the daily report while still maintaining the same format and information previously established.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column centered" style="width:30%;">
            <h2 class="light-gray-background extra-padding">Solution</h2>
            <p>Development of a script that can automatically pull the latest data and generate a daily report including all the necessary trends and charts, with all the correct formatting applied.</p>
