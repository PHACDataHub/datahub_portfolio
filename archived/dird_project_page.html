    <h2 class="light-gray-background extra-padding centered">Background</h2>
    <p>In June 2020, the Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Infectious Diseases (CIRID) approached the Data Hub detailing a need for a platform that centralizes information about vaccines, interventions, and antivirals for various Immunization-related diseases.</p>
    <p>This project, when complete, provides policy and clinical guidance to epidemiologists and policy makers. It will initially focus on COVID-19 related information, and other Immunization-related diseases will be added in subsequent releases.</p>

            <h2 class="light-gray-background extra-padding">Problem</h2>
            <p>Evidence that informs decision-making is exponentially growing, so it is becoming increasingly difficul for human analysts to properly sort through and interpret the emerging data needed to stay abreast of the latest developments in public health.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column centered" style="width:30%;">
            <h2 class="light-gray-background extra-padding">Goal</h2>
            <p>An all-encompassing platform where epidemiologists, data analysts, and decision makers can get curated data based on their needs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column centered" style="width:30%;">
            <h2 class="light-gray-background extra-padding">Solution</h2>
            <p>Develop a dashboard that would encompass information about vaccines, interventions, and antivirals, from various news, scientific, and social media sources. Leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automate current scanning processed done at PHAC.</p>
